I"Ì<p>Well, I guess I am starting off on this journey of learning and discovery. It is so easy to get bogged down in the details and get distracted by all the neat tricks and features. I have spent the last couple days diving into how Jekyll, Ruby, CSS, HTML, and general Web design work. I deeply want to be able to wrap my head around it all, and I felt myself wanting to understand it all before getting started with why I am even here in the first place.</p>
