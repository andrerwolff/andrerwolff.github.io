<p>I recently was reading obout a method that helps in developing complex ideas in a controlled and more straight forward way. Itâ€™s called the <a href="https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/">Snowflake Method</a>. I will summarize the method here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write a one-sentence summary. (&lt;15 words)</li>
  <li>Expand the sentence to a full paragraph. Summarize the 3-Act structure.(~5 sentences)</li>
  <li>Character summaries for each chatacter. (~1 page each)
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Summary of characters story line</li>
      <li>Motivation</li>
      <li>Goal</li>
      <li>Conflict</li>
      <li>Epiphany</li>
      <li>One-paragraph summary</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Expand each sentence of #2 into their own paragraphs.</li>
  <li>Expand #3 into character synopses, tell the story from their points of view. (.5 - 1 page each)</li>
  <li>Expand #4 into 4-5 page synopsis.</li>
  <li>Expand #5 into full character charts</li>
