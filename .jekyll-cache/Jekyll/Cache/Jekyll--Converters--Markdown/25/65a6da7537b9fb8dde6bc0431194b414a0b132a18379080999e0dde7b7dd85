I"©<p>Whelp, I guess I am starting off on this journey of learning and discovery. It is so easy to get bogged down in the details and get distracted by all the neat tricks and features. I have spent the last couple days diving into how Jekyll, Ruby, CSS, HTML, and general Web design work.I deeply want to be able to wrap my head around it all, and I felt myself wanting to understand it all before getting started with why I am even here in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>SOooOo</strong>, thatâ€™s why I am writing this now, to get it out of the way. No need to wrack my brain to come up with the perfect thing to say or way to say it. I need to work on quantity over quality for the time being, otherwise both would be sitting at near zero.</p>
