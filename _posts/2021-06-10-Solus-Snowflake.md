![Snowflake](\assets\images\Von_Koch_curve.gif)

I recently was reading obout a method that helps in developing complex ideas in a controlled and more straight forward way. It's called the [Snowflake Method](https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/). I will summarize the method here:
1. Write a one-sentence summary. (<15 words)
2. Expand the sentence to a full paragraph. Summarize the 3-Act structure.(~5 sentences)
3. Character summaries for each chatacter. (~1 page each)
    - Name
    - Summary of characters story line
    - Motivation
    - Goal
    - Conflict
    - Epiphany
    - One-paragraph summary
4. Expand each sentence of #2 into their own paragraphs.
5. Expand #3 into character synopses, tell the story from their points of view. (.5 - 1 page each)
6. Expand #4 into 4-5 page synopsis.
