### Emotional Intelligence and the Importance of Self Management 
----
----
- Emotional intelligence can lead to psychological resilience by encouraging and recognizing people (employees) need to manage emotions.
- Two views from HR:
    - Gives a business an edge over others that lack EI.
    - EI is too hard to quantify and vague, EI is a misnomer.
- Pyramid of EI
    - Personal Sphere
        - Self Awareness / Knowing emotions
        - Self Management / Managing emotions
    - Social Sphere
        - Social Awareness / Understand Others Emotions
        - Relationship Management
- Usually easier to manage others over self, making self management the end goal.
- "He who has conquered himself has conquered the world!"

### Words with Friends
----
----
- Outcomes of incomplete collaboration:
  - Failure to meet elevated expectations.
  - Higher operating costs and reduced efficiencies.
- Word 1 - Professional
  - Engineering professional training based on theory and detailed design while operators professional training based on practical experience.
  - Need to merge these perspectives to get to sweet spot.
- Word 2 - Respect
  - Day to day challenges can de-prioritize acceptance of feedback.
  - Ignoring perspectives will manifest in negative outcomes. 
  - Respect Cycle:
    - Inviting Conversation -> Deep Listening -> Considering Feedback -> Create Buy-In -> Repeat
    - Buy-In is critical whether or not it was accepted, stakeholders should know they were heard and know the basis of decision making.
- Word 3 - Grace
  - Attitude of generosity and goodwill.
  - Step back from pressure and high-performance environments to focus on uniting values.

### From Hendrix to Floyd
----
----
- Limiting element for capturing the value of innovation is the ability to translate ideas in to connections with people. 
- Innovative ideas pass through a prism of emotional intelligence, taking white light and translating it for regulators (red), financiers (orange), operations (yellow), etc..,
  - Self Awareness
    : Allows for vulnerability and acceptance of feedback, foundational.
  - Emotional Management
    : Outgrowth of self awareness, depersonalization and authenticity drive to produce an outcome beyond self-interest.
  - Emotional Connection
    : Highest skill level, using empathy, listening, communication, and mentoring to produce tangible results.
- Innovative organizations are produced by hiring/developing leaders who posses trifecta of technical skills, professional experience, and emotional intelligence.
- Career tracks should be defined and separate for technical leadership and emotionally intelligent leadership.

### Tips for Emotional Self Awareness 
***Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child*** by _John Gottman_

----
----
- Building emotional awareness requires a bit of solitude.
- Keep and emotion log/emotion diary to become more aware of incidents of thoughts that trigger your emotions.
- Writing down and naming these can help define and contain the feelings.

### What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
---
---
- Employee performance optimization is not enough in a growing team based, global, and complex business environment.
- Groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, and find better solutions.
- Project Aristotle studied 180 teams at google looking for various factors tht determine group performance. Almost no patters were found based on typical metrics (hobbies, gender, backgrounds, extroverts/introverts).
- Group Norm
  : Traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.
- Group norms typically override individual proclivities.
- The 'right' group norms can raise the collective intelligence, 'wrong' norms can hobble a group of otherwise exceptionally bright members.
- Of various norms successful groups had similar attributes:
  - Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.
  - High average social sensitivity.
  - Psychological safety
    : A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up. Interpersonal trust and mutual respect where people are comfortable with being themselves.
  - All Google's intense data collection and number crunching led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known: In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.
  - Follow your gut.

### Business Case for Emotional Intelligence
---
---
- More resources, incentives will not fix all issues.
- EI protects leaders and management from derailment from deficits in handling change, teamwork, and interpersonal relations.
- Leaders with EI have a solid level of self-awareness about the link between their behavior and how it makes others feel and perform. 
- Three abilities that high EI leaders demonstrate:
  - Able to admit mistakes
  - Listen without jumping to conclusions
  - Not avoiding difficult conversations and able to hold people accountable
- Employees more willing to give extra effort when managers exhibit high EI.
- Training managers in EI leads to reduced turnover, absenteeism, and increased engagement, sales performance, and productivity.
