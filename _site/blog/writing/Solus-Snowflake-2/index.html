<blockquote>
  <p>Solus: A man wakes up in a shipwreck on an alien planet and embarks on a journey of repeated self discoveries to find a way back home.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>The main character wakes up within the wreckage of a ‘Starliner’ on a remote wasteland planet. As he explores his surroundings he realizes there had been another survivor that set up a makeshift camp and stockpiled supplies and equipment. Using a map and journal found at the camp the main character re-traces the last steps of the previous survivor. Upon finding his dead body the main character realizes that the survivor looks exactly like him. Using a small chip found in the dead survivors neck, the main character is able to incorporate the memories of the dead survivor. With a better knowledge of the situation, the main character sets out to find the group responsible for the death of his predecessor and find a way off of the planet. During this time he dies several times, each time booting up a new clone that must find the body and carry on the mission and finally out-smarting a group of bandits to steal their ship and return home.<br /> <br /></p>

<p>Epilogue - The clone has started a new life on his home planet and is killed in an accident, waking up back on the remote planet…</p>
