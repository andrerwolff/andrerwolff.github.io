<ul>
  <li>Employee performance optimization is not enough in a growing team based, global, and complex business environment.</li>
  <li>Groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, and find better solutions.</li>
  <li>Project Aristotle studied 180 teams at google looking for various factors tht determine group performance. Almost no patters were found based on typical metrics (hobbies, gender, backgrounds, extroverts/introverts).</li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt>Group Norm</dt>
      <dd>Traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>Group norms typically override individual proclivities.</li>
  <li>The ‘right’ group norms can raise the collective intelligence, ‘wrong’ norms can hobble a group of otherwise exceptionally bright members.</li>
  <li>Of various norms successful groups had similar attributes:
    <ul>
      <li>Equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.</li>
      <li>High average social sensitivity.</li>
      <li>
        <dl>
          <dt>Psychological safety</dt>
          <dd>A sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up. Interpersonal trust and mutual respect where people are comfortable with being themselves.</dd>
        </dl>
      </li>
      <li>All Google’s intense data collection and number crunching led it to the same conclusions that good managers have always known: In the best teams, members listen to one another and show sensitivity to feelings and needs.</li>
      <li>Follow your gut.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <ul>

      <li>Listen without jumping to conclusions</li>
      <li>Not avoiding difficult conversations and able to hold people accountable</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Employees more willing to give extra effort when managers exhibit high EI.</li>
  <li>Training managers in EI leads to reduced turnover, absenteeism, and increased engagement, sales performance, and productivity.</li>
</ul>
