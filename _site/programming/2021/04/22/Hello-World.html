<p>Well, I guess I am starting off on this journey of learning and discovery. It is so easy to get bogged down in the details and get distracted by all the neat tricks and features. I have spent the last couple days diving into how Jekyll, Ruby, CSS, HTML, and general Web design work. I deeply want to be able to wrap my head around it all, and I felt myself wanting to understand it all before getting started with why I am even here in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>SOooOo</strong>, that’s why I am writing this now, to get it out of the way. No need to wrack my brain to come up with the perfect thing to say or way to say it. I need to work on quantity over quality for the time being, otherwise both would be sitting at near zero.</p>
